# Recipe Ratings Analysis

## Introduction
This project investigates recipe ratings using a dataset from Food.com that includes over 200,000 recipes and user-submitted reviews since 2008. Each recipe includes metadata such as preparation time, number of steps, and detailed nutritional information. The central question I explore is: what features of a recipe are associated with receiving a higher average rating? Understanding which types of recipes perform well could be useful for food bloggers, home chefs, or platforms recommending recipes. The dataset used has approximately X rows and includes relevant columns such as minutes, n_steps, description, and parsed nutritional values like calories, protein, and sugar.
